# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Classification using CNN-Based Model
## Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia Problem
#### Definition:
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) starts from white blood cells in the bone marrow that become leukemic. 
- Leukemic Lymphocytes block the production of normal cells, multiply uncontrollably, and survive better than normal cells.
#### Motivation:
If caught early, leukemia can be cured by undergoing several cancer treatments. An AI system was trained to estimate 3-year lung cancer risk from radiologistsâ€™ computed tomography (CT) readings and other clinical information. These predictions could then be used to schedule follow-up CT scans for patients with cancer, augmenting current screening guidelines. Validation of such systems on multiple clinical sites and an increasing number of prospective evaluations have brought AI closer to being deployed and making a practical impact in the field of radiology.
